# Production vs Development Data Sync Analysis

## Current Status

### Development Environment ✅
- **Database Connection**: Working properly  
- **Total Users**: 16 (1 admin + 15 employees)
- **Today's Attendance**: 15 records
- **API Endpoints**: All functioning correctly
- **Employee Directory**: All 16 users visible
- **Attendance Management**: All data synced properly

### Production Environment ❌  
- **Database Connection**: Same database but API routing issue
- **Static Files**: Only HTML/CSS/JS served, no API responses
- **Root Cause**: Replit deployment serving static assets instead of Express server
- **API Routes**: Not accessible (404 or HTML responses)

## Root Cause Analysis

**The production deployment is serving the built static files from the dist folder instead of running the Express server.** This is why:

1. All API calls return HTML instead of JSON
2. Authentication fails (no session management)
3. Database data not accessible through web interface
4. New data added via production won't reflect in interface

## Solution Required

1. **Redeploy Application**: Fix deployment configuration to serve Express server
2. **Verify API Routes**: Ensure production API endpoints are accessible
3. **Test Complete Flow**: Login → Employee Directory → Attendance → All sections

## Expected Outcome

After proper deployment, production should show the same data as development:
- 16 employees in directory
- 15 attendance records for today  
- All sections properly synced
- New data additions immediately visible in both environments
