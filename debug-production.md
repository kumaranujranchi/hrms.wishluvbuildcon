# Production Database Synchronization Issue

## Problem Analysis
- Development environment: Working correctly with 6 users
- Production deployment: Static files served instead of API responses
- Database connection: Same PostgreSQL database (neondb)
- Users exist in database but production login fails

## Database Current State
- Users: 6 records (admin + employees)
- Attendance: 5 records  
- Sessions: 6 records
- Database size: ~9MB
- PostgreSQL version: 16.9

## Test Users in Development Database
1. test.employee@wishluvbuildcon.com (Employee)
2. employee1@wishluvbuildcon.com (Employee) 
3. employee2@wishluvbuildcon.com (Employee)
4. awinash.mishra@wishluvbuildcon.com (Employee)
5. shubham.kumar@wishluvbuildcon.com (Employee)
6. anuj.kumar@wishluvbuildcon.com (Admin)

## Root Cause
Production deployment is serving static assets and not routing to API endpoints properly. This suggests:

1. **Environment Issue**: Production deployment might be using different environment variables
2. **Build Issue**: Production build not including backend API routes
3. **Deployment Config**: Replit deployment configuration issue with Express server setup

## Solution Required
1. Fix production deployment to serve API routes correctly
2. Ensure same DATABASE_URL is used in production
3. Verify authentication and session management in production
4. Test actual API endpoints in production environment

## Next Steps
- Deploy the application and verify production API routing
- Test login functionality with existing users
- Compare production vs development database access
